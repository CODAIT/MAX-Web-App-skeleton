# MAX Web App skeleton

> This is a fully functioning skeleton for MAX model web apps. This web app will work as is for
any MAX model running on port `5000` with an image input and json output. This skeleton is meant
to be used as a base for any new MAX web apps created by the CODAIT dev team.

A web app utilizing the [INSERT MAX MODEL NAME]([INSERT MAX MODEL GITHUB]) model

# Steps

## Run Locally

### Start the Model API

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 codait/[INSERT MAX MODEL SLUG]
```

This will pull a pre-built image from Docker Hub (or use an existing image if already cached locally) and run it.
If you'd rather build and run the model locally, or deploy on a Kubernetes cluster, you can follow the steps in the
[model README](https://github.com/IBM/[INSERT MAX MODEL NAME]/#steps).

### Start the Web App

#### 1. Get a local copy of the repository

Clone the web app repository locally. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CODAIT/MAX-Web-App-skeleton.git
```

Change directory into the repository base folder:

```
$ cd MAX-Web-App-skeleton
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure Node.js and npm are installed then, in a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

#### 3. Start the web app server

You then start the web app by running:

```
$ node app
```

You can then access the web app at: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

#### 4. Configure ports (Optional)

If you want to use a different port or are running the model API at a different location you can change them with command-line options:

```
$ node app --port=[new port] --model=[endpoint url including protocol and port]
```
